*Incomplete Game*

HOW TO PLAY:

In this game, the player moves a PADDLE from side-to-side using the "LEFT and RIGHT" arrow keys to hit a BALL. To launch the BALL press the "SPACEBAR". The gameâ€™s objective is to eliminate all of the BRICKS at the top of the screen by hitting them with the BALL. But, if the ball hits the bottom ENCLOSURE, the player loses and the game ends! 

To win the game, all the BRICKS must be eliminated.
